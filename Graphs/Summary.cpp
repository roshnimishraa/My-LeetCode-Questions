1. Time Complexity of DFS & BFS -> O(V) + O(E) 

2. Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph
a) DFS -> parent & node & vis
b) BFS -> queue {node,parent}, vis

3. Detect Cycle in Directed Graph 
a) DFS -> vis & pathVis
b) BFS -> 

4. DFS Approach (Islands) 
i) No. of Islands -> DFS traversal & vis & count 
ii) No. of Distinct Island -> DFS & vis & vector of pair of list & set to store unique list return st.size() 
  
5. Bipartite Graph 
 Time complexity: O(V+E).
Auxiliary Space: O(V)
i) BFS Approach : 
Take queue and color(v,-1) take color initlially 0 
ii) DFS Approach : 
Take currentColor,color,node,adj

6. Topological Sort
