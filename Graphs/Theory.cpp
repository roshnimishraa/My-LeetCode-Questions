Path : 
i) The path contains a lot of nodes and each of them is reachable.
ii) A node can not appear twice in a path 

Walk : 
i) The path contains a lot of nodes and each of them is reachable.
ii) A node can appear twice in a path 

Degree of Graph:
It is the number of edges that go inside or outside that node.

  For Undirected Graph : Total Degree of a graph = 2 * Edges 
eg.  social network

For Directed Graph : The indegree of a node is the number of incoming edges. The outdegree of a node is the number of outgoing edges.
eg. www(world wide web)

Graph Representation 
 1. Adjacency Matrix : It is symmetric for undirected graph
     Space Required : O(V * V) 
 2. Adjacency List
     Space Required : O(2 * Edges)
