Dijkstra Algorithm ~ Single Source Shortest Path 
Very Famous Greedy Algorithm and give Optimal solution 

>> Condition : 
1. Works only for Connected Graph
2. It works only for those graph that don't contain any negative weight edge.
3. It only provides the value or cost of the shortest path 
4. Works for both directed and undirected graph

It can be implemented using : 
1. Queue : More Slow 
2. Priority Queue : Slow 
3. Set : Fast (TC)
