Types of Binary Trees
1. Complete Binary Tree
2. Perfect Binary Tree
3. Balanced Binary Tree 
4. Degenerate Binary Tree
5. Full Binary Tree 


1. Complete Binary Tree : 
  a) All levels are completely filled except the last level.
  b) the last level has full nodes m as left as possible.

2. Perfect Binary Tree : 
   All the leaf nodes are at same level.

3. Balanced Binary Tree : 
   Height of tree at max log(N) nodes
 n =8 
log 8 = 3 (height should be 3)

4. Degenerate Tree : Left skew or Right skew Tree

5. Full Binary Tree : Either has 0 or 2 children. 

  No. of Nodes in Binary Tree = 2 * h â€“ 1


  Tree Traversal is of Two Types : 
1. DFS (Depth-First Search) 
 a. Inorder
 b. Preorder
c. Postorder
  
  2. BFS/ Level order Traversal
