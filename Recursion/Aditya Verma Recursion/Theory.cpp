>> When to use Recursion 
  Decision -> as a result -> Input smaller 

>> Recursive Tree -> Input - output method 

>> How to solve Recursion problem 
1. Design a Recursive tree
2. Write the code

>> Ways to solve Recursive problem 
For Simple problem -> use Induction - Base - Hypothesis method 
For Medium problem -> Recursive Tree 
For Hard problem -> choice diagram 

Recursion Problem 
>>> I/P - O/P method 
1. Print 1 to N/ N to ` 
2. Sort an array
3. Delete middle element in a stack 
4. Remove duplicates from a string 
5. Count the number of occurences 
6. Subset 
7. Permutation (a) with space (variations) 
               (b) with case changes
8. Josephus problem 

>>> Extended I/P - O/P method 
1. Binary string with no. of 1's > No. of 0's 
2. Generate Balanced Parenthesis
