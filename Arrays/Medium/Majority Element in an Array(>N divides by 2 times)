Brute force : Two Inner for loops 
TC : O(N)^2
SC : O(1) 
The steps are as follows:

1. We will run a loop that will select the elements of the array one by one.
2. Now, for each element, we will run another loop and count its occurrence in the given array.
3. If any element occurs more than the floor of (N/2), we will simply return it.

Better Approach : Hashing 
TC : O(1)
